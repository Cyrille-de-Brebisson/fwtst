// in this format, we have 1 item per line. with no spaces at the begining of the line
// note that any line that does NOT start by a known property will be ignored

// Each device definition starts with:
// device:internal_mame user facing name until end of line
// Then, we will see a list of "properties" for said device.
// At this point in time, we only support fw properties, but more might be added later.
// a fw definition starts with:
// device.fw:ver min_ver user_text_to_end_of_line
// followed by a url definition
// device.fw.url:url_to_end_of_line
// and as many release notes as needed where "lang" is a 2 letter language specification
// device.fw.note:lang user_text_to_end_of_line
